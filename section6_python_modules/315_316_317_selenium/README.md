Download Google Chrome Driver
Access the url page and look for the current release:
- https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Today I have downloaded the file from:
- https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

Unzip compressed file downloaded inside 'drivers' folder.

The connection between code and navigator is created using the DRIVER and SELENIUM.

This DRIVER exists for each navigator and for each Operating System.
